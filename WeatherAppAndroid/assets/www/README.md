# Weather

A basic 5-day weather forecast. Uses geolocation (if available) to locate the
user and retrieve the conditions nearest to them. Also allows the user to add
other cities and choose the temperature format.

Makes use of the Chrome Storage API to save and load the cities and settings
that the user has chosen
